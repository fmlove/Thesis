## Plasmids and antibodies



## Other reagents

## Software

Wherever possible, I tried to use free and open source software throughout this project.  All image analysis tasks were carried out in Fiji [@schindelinFijiOpensourcePlatform2012].  Quantitative analysis and statistics were carried out in R []. FinchTV and Serial Cloner were used for reading DNA sequences and designing plasmids, respectively. 

## Protocols
### Plasmid preparation

All plasmid preparation was carried out using either DH5$\alpha$ *(New England BioLabs, C2987I/H)* or XL10-Gold *(Agilent Technilogies, 200314)* competent cells.  Cells were transformed using a heat shock protocol, and grown on LB/agar plates with an appropriate antibody for plasmid selection.  Single colonies were then scaled up in LB culture.  Plasmids were purified from *E. coli* cultures using Qiagen Spin Miniprep *(27104)* or EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kits *(12362)* according to the manufacturer's protocols.  All plasmids were dissolved in ultrapure DNAse-free water *(Thermo Fisher, 10977035)* for transfection.

### Cortical neuron cultures

Primary cortical neurons were obtained from E18 Sprague Dawley rats. Cortices were dissected in HEPES-HBSS and dissociated with papain for approximately 5 minutes at 37°, followed by DNAse treatment and trituration through a flame-polished glass pipette. Cells were filtered through a 40$\mu$m cell strainer *(Falcon, 352340)* and plated at a density of 200K-400K cells per imaging plate *(Greiner Bio-One, 627860)*. Plates were coated with 2mg/mL poly-D-lysine *(SigmaAldrich, P1149)* in borate buffer.  Cells were grown in MACS Neuro Medium *(Miltenyi Biotec, 130-093-570)*, supplemented with NeuroBrew-21 *(Miltenyi Biotec, 130-093-566)*, GlutaMAX *(Thermo Fisher, 35050061)*, and ITS *(R&D Systems, AR013)* at 37° with 7% CO~2~. 

### Transfection

Cortical neurons were transfected by either magnetofection or calcium phosphate.




HeLa cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 reagent *(Mirus Bio, MIR2300)*, according to the manufacturer's protocol.

### Immunocytochemistry

Cortical neurons were fixed using formaldehyde and sucrose, dissolved in PBS and mixed into the growth media to final concentrations of 3% formaldehyde and 10% sucrose.  HeLa cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS.  In both cases, cells were fixed for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by PBS washes and stored at 4$^{\circ}$.  

Cells were permeabilised with 0.2% saponin, to preserve the localisation of membrane-associated proteins.

### Microscopy

### Image analysis

All image analysis was conducted in Fiji.  In most cases, custom macros were used for batch processing and streamlining manual tasks.  

All manual image analysis was conducted blind, with the exception of (LC3 FIG NEURON PANEL), where cells were classified while they were being examined on the microscope.  In most cases, blinding was achieved using the *blinds* R package to replace descriptive file names with unique identifiers, which can then be reversed after manual analysis.  While I wrote the package for this project, it is generally applicable and publicly available on GitHub (CITE, GET ZENODO DOI).  Where it was not possible to obscure the file names (e.g. where ROIs were being matched to images by name), steps were taken in the analysis macros to randomise image order and hide the experimental condition.
