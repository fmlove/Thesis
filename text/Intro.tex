\hypertarget{the-challenge-of-cns-regeneration}{%
\subsection{The challenge of CNS
regeneration}\label{the-challenge-of-cns-regeneration}}

One of the greatest challenges of modern medicine is how to promote
regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). Compared to most other
tissues and organs in the human body, the CNS has exceptionally low
regenerative ability. As a result, damage to the CNS - whether through
trauma, infection, or disease - often results in lifelong disability. In
contrast, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is capable of substantial
regeneration after injury, with severed nerves able to regrow several
centimetres, reach their targets, and form functional connections,
suggesting that regeneration of the CNS might be medically possible, if
we can identify the relevant factors at play. While there has been
active research in this area for decades (if not centuries), we are
still a long way from what most people would consider `successful'
regeneration of damaged CNS tissues - the regrowth of damaged neuronal
processes, appropriate remodelling of the extracellular environment, and
restoration of functional synaptic connections. In this section, I will
summarise our current understanding of some of the factors limiting CNS
regeneration, as well as the particular challenges I have decided to
address with this project.

\hypertarget{glaucoma}{%
\subsubsection{Glaucoma}\label{glaucoma}}

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible sight loss worldwide. It
is estimated that over 3.5\% of the world population aged 40-80 is
affected by glaucoma, which has an enormous impact on quality of life
for millions of people {[}1{]}. While we do have drugs that can slow or
even halt the progression of this disease, they cannot reverse damage
that has already occurred, and the typical progression of glaucoma (with
sight loss beginning at the periphery) means that it is often diagnosed
at a late stage. Furthermore, up to 10\% of people do not respond to the
first line treatment drugs, so there is a significant need for improved
therapies {[}CITE{]}.

While many approaches so far have targeted the increased intraocular
pressure typically considered a hallmark of glaucoma, there are cases
where degeneration occurs despite normal pressure in the eye, and it is
not entirely clear what drives the disease progression in these cases
{[}CITE{]}. Therefore, it is important to develop therapies that can
target the neurodegeneration directly, rather than just intraocular
pressure. To that end, we have been investigating how to prevent
degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, and how to promote
regeneration of cells that are already damaged. By delving into the
biology of why CNS neurons fail to regenerate and how we can change
this, we hope to introduce a new class of therapeutics that can be
applied both to glaucoma and to other CNS diseases or injuries.

\hypertarget{factors-limiting-cns-regeneration}{%
\subsection{Factors limiting CNS
regeneration}\label{factors-limiting-cns-regeneration}}

In 1980, Peter Richardson and colleagues at McGill showed that axons in
a severed rat spinal cord could regenerate into an implanted sciatic
nerve graft, thus demonstrating that CNS neurons were at least somewhat
capable of regeneration, but were inhibited by their environment
{[}2{]}. There are a variety of environmental factors that can limit CNS
axon growth, ranging from differences in the cellular composition of PNS
and CNS tissues, to changes in the extracellular environment and cell
surface receptors that occur as an organism ages.

However, other studies have shown that changes \emph{within} neurons
also present a barrier to CNS regeneration. As the cells mature from a
developmental, growth-permissive state into mature, synaptically active
neurons, they undergo structural and functional changes that in many
cases seem incompatible with regeneration. Additionally, many
neurodegenerative diseases stem from genetic or functional disruption
within neurons, as opposed to the extracellular environment.
Understanding and addressing these intrinsic sources of dysfunction and
barriers to regeneration is essential to developing successful therapies
for CNS protection and regeneration.

\hypertarget{synaptogenesis}{%
\subsubsection{Synaptogenesis}\label{synaptogenesis}}

Recent work has increasingly pointed to the formation of synapses as the
key point at which developing CNS neurons lose their capacity to
regenerate. During this process, interactions with the external cellular
environment trigger internal changes that encourage signalling function
at the expense of inhibiting growth. For example, {[}3{]} showed that a
voltage-gated calcium channel subunit prevents axon growth, and that
inhibiting the channel can promote regeneration \emph{in vivo}. {[}4{]}
found a similar effect with presynaptic vesicle-tethering proteins, and
also found that cells that were capable of regeneration down-regulated
these proteins during axon growth.

\hypertarget{cytoskeleton}{%
\subsubsection{Cytoskeleton}\label{cytoskeleton}}

Neurons undergo dramatic morphological changes during development,
eventually forming extremely long, thin, and complex structures that, in
some cases, must be carefully maintained for the entire lifetime of the
organism. To make this possible, mature neurons have a dynamic but
highly regulated cytoskeleton, particularly in the axon. However, the
structural requirements of the mature, signal-carrying axon are very
different from a growing axon, and in the case of axon injury this can
prevent successful regeneration.

A key feature of the mature neuronal cytoskeleton is the bundle of
polarised microtubules that forms the backbone of the axon. This
structure is maintained by proteins such as Efa6, which truncates
growing microtubules that leave the bundle to reach the axon periphery.
However, this can also inhibit axon outgrowth, which might limit
regeneration {[}5{]}.

At the axon tip, a delicate balance of microtubule polymerisation and
stabilisation at the axon tip promotes forward extension of the growth
cone and axon elongation during development. This can be partially
restored in mature axons with the addition of microtubule-stabilising
drugs, but the effect is highly dose-dependent, with higher doses
instead inhibiting axon growth (reviewed in {[}6{]}).

\hypertarget{signalling}{%
\subsubsection{Signalling}\label{signalling}}

Many of the internal changes that occur during neuronal maturation are
regulated through distinct signalling pathways, which help switch the
cell between growing and quiescent states.

\hypertarget{pten-and-mtor}{%
\paragraph{PTEN and mTOR}\label{pten-and-mtor}}

One of the most-studied signalling pathways in the context of CNS repair
is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The levels of PIP\textsubscript{3}, an
important signalling lipid, are developmentally regulated in neurons.
PIP\textsubscript{3} is produced from PIP\textsubscript{2} by PI3K,
while the reverse reaction is catalysed by PTEN. During growth, a
balance of both enzymes maintain sufficient PIP\textsubscript{3} levels
to promote growth via AKT kinase and downstream targets such as mTOR. As
neurons mature, however, expression levels of PI3K decline, while PTEN
remains high. The result is a decline in PIP\textsubscript{3}, and
subsequent decrease in AKT signalling. Restoring PIP\textsubscript{3}
levels in mature levels, either through PTEN deletion or PI3K
expression, can strongly promote axon regeneration{[}7,8,reviewed in
9{]}.

\hypertarget{other-signalling-pathways}{%
\paragraph{Other signalling pathways}\label{other-signalling-pathways}}

Numerous other pathways have also been implicated in the failure of
regeneration in the CNS. {[}10{]} found that SOCS3 - a negative
regulator of cytokine signalling - inhibited axon regeneration in mouse
RGCs by blocking responses to external growth factors, and that deleting
SOCS3 promoted regeneration. {[}11{]} showed that DRG regeneration into
the CNS following a conditioning lesion was dependent on cAMP and PKA to
overcome inhibitory signals from the extracellular environment. These
pathways all overlap or interact to some degree, but it is still unclear
how they may be differentially regulated in the case of axonal injury,
or if this varies across cell types.

\hypertarget{epigenetic-and-transcriptional-regulation}{%
\subsubsection{Epigenetic and transcriptional
regulation}\label{epigenetic-and-transcriptional-regulation}}

Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons are unique in that they extend axons
into both the peripheral and central nervous systems. As peripheral
neurons, they are capable of axonal regeneration, although this is
usually only successful in the peripheral branch, due to the inhibitory
extracellular environment of the CNS. However, their regenerative
capacity in the CNS is vastly enhanced by a prior injury to the
peripheral axon. Changes in gene expression and regulation that occur in
the weeks following a peripheral lesion can allow these cells to
regenerate through the inhibitory environment of a spinal cord lesion,
raising the possibility that similar changes could convey similar
capacity in neurons of the CNS {[}12{]}.

This `conditioning lesion' phenomenon in DRG neurons has provided an
invaluable model to identifying epigenetic and transcriptomic changes
that permit PNS regeneration but are normally lacking in the CNS. For
example, {[}13{]} found that histone modification was essential for the
conditioning lesion effect, and activated signalling cascades to promote
axonal growth. {[}14{]} found that DRG neurons upregulate TET3 after
axon injury, which in turn demethylates DNA and allow the activation of
regeneration-associated genes. They also found that the regeneration
induced by PTEN deletion in RGCs was dependent on TET1, a similar
protein.

Other work has identified transcription factors that may play a role in
axon regeneration. {[}15{]} suggest that different members of the KLF
family of transcription factors differentially regulate the regenerative
capacity of RGCs, while {[}16{]} pointed to ATF3 and c-Jun as key
regulators. This is by no means an enhaustive list, and a significant
amount of work is ongoing in this area to identify genes that can
potentially be targeted to promote regeneration.

\hypertarget{intracellular-transport}{%
\subsubsection{Intracellular transport}\label{intracellular-transport}}

After synapse formation, axons undergo dramatic changes in transport, as
much growth machinery is excluded in favour of synapse components and
synaptic vesicle precursors. This results in decreased transport of some
essential organelles, which can inhibit survival and regrowth in the
case of injury.

\hypertarget{recycling-endosomes}{%
\paragraph{Recycling endosomes}\label{recycling-endosomes}}

Among the organelles excluded from mature axons are Rab11 recycling
endosomes. While they play a key role in recycling internalised
receptors to the plasma membrane, they also transport cargo into axons
{[}17{]}. One such cargo is integrins, which are essential for focal
adhesion formation and axonal growth. In DRG neurons, integrin
\(\alpha9\) can promote axon regeneration even into the inhibitory
environment of the spinal cord {[}18{]}. However, integrins are excluded
from mature CNS axons by small GTPase Arf6 and its activator Efa6.
Inhibiting Efa6 allows integrins into the axon and promotes regeneration
after axotomy \emph{in vitro} {[}19{]}.

\hypertarget{mitochondria}{%
\paragraph{Mitochondria}\label{mitochondria}}

Similar changes in mitochondrial motility have been identified. {[}20{]}
found that mitochondrial motility decreased with age in cortical
neurons, and mature mitochondria were often stationary near presynapses.
{[}21{]} found that chondroitin sylphate proteoglycans - key components
of the CNS extracellular matrix, and potent inhibitors of axon
regeneration - prevented mitochondria from reaching the growth cones of
regenerating DRG neurons. {[}22{]} linked this change even more directly
to axon regeneration, showing that artificially enhancing mitochondrial
transport into axons could boost regeneration, albeit in the PNS.

\hypertarget{the-virtuous-cycle-of-axon-growth}{%
\subsubsection{The virtuous cycle of axon
growth}\label{the-virtuous-cycle-of-axon-growth}}

Many of these intrinsic factors interact in what has been described as
the `virtuous cycle of axon growth' {[}23{]}. As explained in detail in
that review, changes in axon transport with neuronal maturation lead to
lower levels of growth factor receptors in the distal axon. This in turn
mutes the cell's responses to growth factors in the extracellular
environment, and prevents the activation of growth-promoting
transcription and signalling cascades. By targeting any stage of this
cycle - or indeed multiple stages - it should be possible to restore
mature neurons to a growing state and allow regeneration.

\hypertarget{protrudin}{%
\subsection{Protrudin}\label{protrudin}}

Protrudin is an interesting protein in the context of axon regeneration
because it sits at the nexus of several of these intrinsic systems that
can prevent regeneration. As a result, targeting protrudin has the
potential to substantially influence a neuron's regenerative capacity by
synergistically acting on multiple different pathways.

\hypertarget{structure-and-localisation}{%
\subsubsection{Structure and
localisation}\label{structure-and-localisation}}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Intro_files/figure-latex/ptdn-schematic-1.pdf}
\caption{Schematic of protrudin showing transmembrane domains and
binding motifs. The ER lumen is to the bottom of the image.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{cellular-outgrowth-migration-and-invasion}{%
\subsubsection{Cellular outgrowth, migration, and
invasion}\label{cellular-outgrowth-migration-and-invasion}}

Protrudin, otherwise known as ZFYVE27, is so named because its
overexpression induces the growth of long cellular protrusions in HeLa
cells {[}24{]}. Subsequent work has shown similar effects on a number of
cell types {[}25{]}, and indicated a role for protrudin in
outgrowth-dependent processes, such as migration and cancer cell
invasion {[}26,27{]}. However, the underlying mechanisms of these
effects are not fully understood, and there are a number of potential
pathways that could contribute.

\hypertarget{intro-ptdn-transport}{%
\subsubsection{Transport}\label{intro-ptdn-transport}}

Protrudin contains a kinesin binding site, indicating a role in
mediating motor protein-mediated transport. In particular, this would
promote plus-end directed transport, which is essential for delivering
cargo into the long axons of CNS neurons. Matsuzaki et al. {[}28{]}
studied this in some depth, and found that protrudin's
outgrowth-promoting effect in HeLa cells is attenuated if KIF5 is
inhibited, and increased if KIF5 is also overexpressed. They found
evidence for direct protrudin-KIF5 interaction in mouse brains, and
identified protrudin as the KIF5 adaptor for SURF4, Rab11, VAPA/B, and
RTN3. As these proteins are essential for ER function, contact site
formation, protein transport, and a number of other processes, this
suggests that, even at the low levels found endogenously in CNS neurons
(CITE), protrudin plays an important role in normal axonal function.

Petrova et al. {[}29{]}, which I contributed to during the first year of
my PhD, looked at protrudin specifically in the context of integrin
transport. In particular, integrin \(\alpha9\), which is capable of
promoting axon growth in the mature spinal cord {[}CITE{]}, is a cargo
of Rab11 endosomes {[}CITE{]}. We found that protrudin overexpression
had a small effect on developmental neurite outgrowth, but strongly
promoted axon regrowth after axotomy \emph{in vitro}. In addition,
protrudin prevented retinal ganglion cell death after an axon crush
injury \emph{in vivo}, and allowed axons to regrow past the injury site.
I discuss this result further in Chapter 1, section @ref(protrudin-ONC).

In contrast, Raiborg et al. {[}30{]} looked at protrudin's effect on
late endosome transport. Using PC12 cells, they found that protrudin
\emph{indirectly} promoted late endosome transport, forming transient
ER-late endosome contacts at which a separate adaptor, FYCO1 (ZFYVE7),
was able to bind Rab7 and KIF5 to move late endosomes down the axon.

\hypertarget{er-contact-sites}{%
\subsubsection{ER contact sites}\label{er-contact-sites}}

Other studies have indicated a direct role for protrudin at ER-organelle
membrane contact sites (MCS). Protrudin interacts with VAPA/B, key
tethers at many MCS {[}31{]}; {[}28{]}; {[}32{]}; {[}33{]}{]}. It may
also act at ER-mitochondrial contact sites, which are important for
axonal function and growth {[}33,34{]}, and may be disrupted in
neurodegenerative disease (reviewed in {[}35{]}). In addition, protrudin
itself has been shown to act as a tether at ER-endosome contact sites,
as it contains a phophoinositide-binding FYVE domain, as well as several
motifs that can bind Rab proteins {[}30{]}. It may also play a role in
ER-plasma membrane contacts, as protrudin contains a non-canonical FYVE
domain that interacts more strongly with PM lipids than those more
abundant on endosomes {[}36{]}.

\hypertarget{intro-ptdn-axonalER}{%
\subsubsection{Axonal ER}\label{intro-ptdn-axonalER}}

The axonal ER is comprised of only a few very narrow, continuous
tubules, and yet is essential for normal axonal function. As protrudin
localises to ER tubules, it can be found in the axon, although in mature
neurons it is more abundant in the cell body and dendrites. However, it
is not excluded from the axon, as it readily moves into the axon if
overexpressed {[}29{]}. Nevertheless, protrudin interacts with a number
of important axonal ER components, although it remains unclear exactly
what function protrudin has in this compartment.

Protrudin contains a membrane hairpin domain, which is shared with other
proteins that play a role in ER membrane shaping {[}37{]}. Several of
these are implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP), a group of
axon degenerative diseases, which may stem from fragmentation of the
axonal ER {[}38{]}. Protrudin itself has been considered an HSP gene
{[}39{]}, although there is some controversy in this area, and the
`mutation' involved may actually be a benign polymorphism {[}40{]}.
However, protrudin does interact with spastin, atlastin, and other HSP
proteins, so it may still play a role in these conditions{[}37{]}.

While dysfunction of these ER-shaping proteins can lead to axonal
degeneration, their function is also required for axon regeneration,
where they appear to concentrate ER tubules near the growing tip
{[}41{]}. Protrudin may act in the same way, as {[}29{]} found that
protrudin increases the amount of ER in growth cones.

The axonal ER also acts as a local calcium store, and its capacity is
regulated by membrane shaping proteins via tubule diameter. Protrudin
may act in the same way, although it is unclear how this may or may not
contribute to protrudin's regenerative function, as different ER-shaping
proteins have been shown to have opposing effects on axon regeneration
{[}42,43{]}.

\hypertarget{previous-work-on-protrudin}{%
\subsubsection{Previous work on
protrudin}\label{previous-work-on-protrudin}}

With these diverse roles across numerous cellular functions, protrudin
could be influencing neuronal survival and regeneration through several
different mechanisms. Our lab has been working with protrudin for some
time now, having initially become interested in the protein in the
context of integrin transport. This led to the publication of {[}29{]},
which I contributed to, some of which is presented in section
@ref(protrudin-ONC).

This paper presented a number of key findings, which I have built upon
over the course of this project. The foremost of these is that protrudin
overexpression has a striking effect on neuronal survival and
regeneration after axon injury.

My initial aim in starting this project was to further examine the
effect of protrudin on \emph{in vivo} CNS injury, with an aim towards
developing it further as a gene therapy. Unfortunately, the 2020
coronavirus pandemic and associated disruption necessitated a dramatic
change in direction, and I have subsequently focused on understanding
which cellular pathways contribute to protrudin's beneficial effects.
This is primarily intended to inform the translation of protrudin as a
gene therapy for neurodegenerative conditions and CNS injury, although
it also lays the groundwork for identifying new therapeutic targets in
the same pathways.
