## Conclusions

### Protrudin's role in axonal transport

Perhaps the most surprising finding of this project has been that protrudin overexpression has little if any effect on lysosome or late endosome transport in neurons.  This clearly demonstrates that the effect seen on recycling endosome transport in Petrova et al. is specific, rather than a result of broadly increased axonal transport [@petrovaProtrudinFunctionsEndoplasmic2020].  Initially, this seems to conflict with previous work in other cell types, which suggest that protrudin has a strong effect on late endosome transport and positioning, [@raiborgRepeatedEREndosome2015; @hongPtdIns3PControlsMTORC12017].  However, this is in fact consistent with the mechanism proposed in those studies,  which identifies FYCO1 as the actual adaptor between late endosomes and kinesin.  As numerous RNAseq data sets show that there is extremely little FYCO1 in CNS neurons (figure \@ref(fig:FYCO1-RNAseq-full-figure)), it seems likely that this mechanism is not active in these neurons.  Instead, anterograde lysosome/late endosome transport in axons is probably mediated primarily by the BORC/Arl8b/SKIP mechanism, as suggested by Farias et al. [@fariasBORCKinesin1Ensemble2017].

### Protrudin's role in local translation

Given its effect on ERGIC localisation (figure \@ref(fig:ERGIC53-plot)) and the dynamics of Golgi satellite transport (figure \@ref(fig:St3Gal-full-figure)), it appears that protrudin overexpression might influence the local secretory machinery in axons.  Considering the importance of local translation on axon function and growth, as discussed previously, it is easy to see how this might contribute to both protrudin's neuroprotective and regenerative effects.  Additionally, recent work has indicated a direct link between the level of local translation in axons and their regenerative capacity, supporting the idea that protrudin could act by promoting local protein synthesis [@vanerpAgerelatedLossAxonal2021].

This is worth considering in the context of the previous finding that protrudin increases the amount of Rab11 recycling endosomes in the distal axon [@petrovaProtrudinFunctionsEndoplasmic2020].  Bowen et al. showed that recycling endosomes can play a role in the secretion of locally translated proteins in dendrites, either through Golgi satellites or entirely bypassing Golgi-related compartments [@bowenGolgiindependentSecretoryTrafficking2017].  Therefore, it is possible that these endosomes also comprise part of the secretory machinery in axons, in addition to ERGIC and Golgi satellites. 

Further work will be required to identify the molecular mechanisms at play in this process, and whether it is a result of direct protrudin interactions or is downstream of other cellular effects.  This may well vary for each component of the secretory pathway — for example, protrudin can bind to Rab11 directly to facilitate recycling endosome transport, but no such interactions have yet been identified for ERGIC or Golgi satellites.  The presence of numerous Golgi-related proteins in protrudin interactomes (figure \@ref(fig:proteomics-full-figure)) strongly suggests a direct involvement in ER-Golgi interactions.

### A unifying site of action

The results of this project, taken in combination with previous work, suggests that protrudin is coordinating an 'axon trafficking centre', increasing ER tubules, ERGIC, and recycling endosomes — all key components of the local secretory pathway — in the distal axon.  Through the actions of the virtuous cycle, this arrangement of organelles can promote integrin delivery, facilitate local protein translation, and encourage growth-promoting signalling cascades to increase axonal regeneration.

Whether this coordination occurs through direct interactions or downstream of other cellular effects is unclear, but it seems likely that this is a contributing factor to protrudin's effectiveness as a CNS therapy.  Future work in this area should be focused on the structure and nature of interactions between pathway components (ER, ERGIC, Golgi satellites, and endosomes), how they are recruited to sites of axonal injury or degeneration, and whether they are associated with regenerative ability.  

## Future directions

While this project has provided some answers to how protrudin can promote survival and regeneration, it also raises new questions which should be addressed in future studies.  In addition to the follow-up experiments mentioned above, several other systems should be investigated in the context of protrudin overexpression to understand their impact on its neuroprotective and regenerative effects.

### Autophagy

Protrudin's effects on LC3 localisation, both in HeLa cells and cortical neurons (figure \@ref(fig:LC3-full-figure)), suggest an active role in regulating autophagy.  The preliminary results demonstrated in this project suggest that protrudin may increase autophagy or autophagosome biogenesis.  However, Hong et al. actually found the opposite — protrudin *depletion* promoted autophagy initiation in cultured epithelial cells [@hongPtdIns3PControlsMTORC12017].  

With this in mind, it would be worthwhile to examine further what effect protrudin overexpression has on autophagy.  Given the abundance of literature linking autophagy to neuronal survival (reviewed in [@overhoffMechanismsNeuronalSurvival2021]), this may well represent another pathway through which protrudin acts, particularly in a neuroprotective role.  

### Mitochondria

Previous work has suggested that protrudin may play a role at ER-mitochondrial contact sites [@elbaz-alonPDZD8InteractsProtrudin2020; @chingQuantifyingInterorganelleMembrane2021], although it is not yet clear what effects this may have on the cell.  Preliminary EM data from a collaboration with the Williams lab at the Karolinska Institutet show some unusually long mitochondria in the optic nerves of mice injected intravitreally with AAV2 encoding active protrudin, which were not observed with a GFP control (data not shown).  Work is ongoing to confirm this result and examine potential mechanisms.

### Lipids

The gene ontology analysis in section \@ref(GO-analysis) also highlighted a number of protrudin interactions with genes involved in lipid metabolism.  Ewan et al. identified changes in lipid metabolism as a key factor distinguishing PNS from CNS axon regeneration  [@ewanAscendingDorsalColumn2021].  In another collaborative project with the Williams lab, lipid mass spectroscopy of mouse optic nerves showed that either WT or active protrudin decreased the level of ceramides while increasing hexosylceramides, pointing to an effect on sphingolipid synthesis pathways (data not shown).  The unusual localisation of BODIPY C~5~ ceramide in HeLa cells expressing protrudin also supports the idea of a change in ceramide metabolism (figure \@ref(fig:ceramide-full-figure)).  Further work is ongoing in this area to understand how protrudin overexpression may influence lipid pathways in the cell.
