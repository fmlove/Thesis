This thesis is the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration, with the exception of section \@ref(protrudin-ONC), as specified in the text.

It is not substantially the same as any work that has already been submitted before for any degree or other qualification.

It does not exceed the prescribed word limit for the Clinical Medicine and Clinical Veterinary Medicine Degree Committee.

Studentship funding for this work was provided by Fight for Sight.
