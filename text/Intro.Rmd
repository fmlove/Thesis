One of the greatest challenges of modern medicine is how to promote regneration of the central nervous system (CNS).  Compared to most other tissues and organs in the human body, the CNS has exceptionally low regenerative ability.  As a result, damage to the CNS - whether through trauma, infection, or disease - often results in lifelong disability.  In contrast, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is capable of substantial regeneration after injury, with severed nerves able to regrow several centimeters, reach their targets, and form functional conenctions, suggesting that regeneration of the CNS might be medically possible, if we can identify the relevant factors at play.  While there has been active research in this area for decades (if not centuries), we are still a long way from what most people would consider 'successful' regeneration of damaged CNS tissues -  the regrowth of damaged neuronal processes, appropriate remodelling of the extracellular environment, and restoration of functional synaptic connections.  In this section, I will summarise our current understanding of the factors limiting CNS regeneration, as well as the particular challenges I have decided to address with this project.

## Factors limiting CNS regeneration

In 1980, Peter Richardson and colleagues at McGill showed that axons in a severed rat spinal cord could regenerate into an implanted sciatic nerve graft, thus demonstrating that CNS neurons were at least somewhat capable of regeneration, but were inhibited by their environment [@richardsonAxonsCNSNeurones1980].  There are a variety of environmental factors that can limit CNS axon growth, ranging from differences in the cellular composition of PNS and CNS tissues, to changes in the extracellular environment and cell surface receptors that occur as an organism ages.

However, other studies have shown that changes *within* neurons also present a barrier to CNS regeneration.  As the cells mature from a developmental, growth-permissive state into mature, synaptically active neurons, they undergo structural and functional changes that in many cases seem incompatible with regeneration.  Additionally, many neurodegenerative diseases stem from genetic or functional disruption within neurons, as opposed to the extracellular environment.  Understanding and addressing these intrinsic sources of dysfunction and barriers to regeneration is essential to developing successful therapies for CNS protection and regeneration.


#### Synaptogenesis

Recent work has increasingly pointed to the formation of synapses as the key point at which developing CNS neurons lose their capacity to regenerate.   During this process, interactions with the external cellular environment trigger internal changes that encourage signalling function at the expense of inhibiting growth.  For example, [@tedeschiCalciumChannelSubunit2016] showed that a voltage-gated calcium channel subunit prevents axon growth, and that inhibiting the channel can promote regeneration *in vivo*.  [@hiltonActiveVesiclePriming2022] found a similar effect with presynaptic vesicle-tethering proteins, and also found that cells that were capable of regeneration down-regulated these proteins during axon growth.  

#### Cytoskeleton

Neurons undergo dramatic morphological changes during development, eventually forming extremely long, thin, and complex structures that, in some cases, must be carefully maintained for the entire lifetime of the organism.  To make this possible, mature neurons have a dynamic but highly regulated cytoskeleton, particularly in the axon.  However, the structural requirements of the mature, signal-carrying axon are very different from a growing axon, and in the case of axon injury this can prevent successful regeneration.   

A key feature of the mature neuronal cytoskeleton is the bundle of polarised microtubules that forms the backbone of the axon.  This structure is maintained by proteins such as Efa6, which truncates growing microtubules that leave the bundle to reach the axon periphery.  However, this can also inhibit axon outgrowth, which might limit regeneration [@quEfa6ProtectsAxons2019].  

At the axon tip, a delicate balance of microtubule polymerisation and stabilisation at the axon tip promotes forward extension of the growth cone and axon elongation during development.  This can be partially restored in mature axons with the addition of microtubule-stabilising drugs, but the effect is highly dose-dependent, with higher doses instead inhibiting axon growth (reviewed in [@blanquieCytoskeletonDynamicsAxon2018]).

### Protrudin

Protrudin is an interesting protein in the context of axon regeneration because it sits at the nexus of many of these intrinsic and extrinsic functions.  As a result, it has the potential to substantially influence a neuron's regenerative capacity.

#### Cellular outgrowth, migration, and invasion

Protrudin, otherwise known as ZFYVE27, is so named because its overexpression induces the growth of long cellular protrusions in HeLa cells [@shiraneProtrudinInducesNeurite2006].  Subsequent work has shown similar effects on a number of cell types [@zhangRoleSpastinProtrudin2012], and indicated a role for protrudin in outgrowth-dependent processes, such as migration and cancer cell invasion [@aroraProtrudinRegulatesFAK2022] [@pedersenProtrudinmediatedEREndosome2020].  However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood, and there are a number of potential pathways that could contribute.

#### Transport

Protrudin contains a kinesin binding site, indicating a role in mediating motor protein-mediated transport.  In particular, this would promote plus-end directed transport, which is essential for delivering cargo into the long axons of CNS neurons.  Matsuzaki et al. [@matsuzakiProtrudinServesAdaptor2011] studied this in some depth, and found that protrudin's outgrowth-promoting effect in HeLa cells is attenuated if KIF5 is inhibited, and increased if KIF5 is also overexpressed.  They found evidence for direct protrudin-KIF5 interaction in mouse brains, and identified protrudin as the KIF5 adaptor for SURF4, Rab11, VAPA/B, and RTN3.  As these proteins are essential for ER function, contact site formation, protein transport, and a number of other processes, this suggests that, even at the low levels found endogenously in CNS neurons (CITE), protrudin plays an important role in normal axonal function.

Petrova et al. [@petrovaProtrudinFunctionsEndoplasmic2020], which I contributed to during the first year of my PhD, looked at protrudin specifically in the context of integrin transport.  In particular, integrin $\alpha9$, which is capable of promoting axon growth in the mature spinal cord [], is a cargo of Rab11 endosomes [].  We found that protrudin overexpression had a small effect on developmental neurite outgrowth, but strongly promoted axon regrowth after axotomy *in vitro*.  In addition, protrudin prevented retinal ganglion cell death after an axon crush injury *in vivo*, and allowed axons to regrow past the injury site.  I discuss this result further in (CROSS-REFERENCE).

In contrast, Raiborg et al. [@raiborgRepeatedEREndosome2015] looked at protrudin's effect on late endosome transport.  Using PC12 cells, they found that protrudin *indirectly* promoted late endosome transport, forming transient ER-late endosome contacts at which a separate adaptor, FYCO1 (ZFYVE7), was able to bind Rab7 and KIF5 to move late endosomes down the axon.

#### ER contact sites

Other studies have indicated a direct role for protrudin at ER-organelle membrane contact sites (MCS).  Protrudin interacts with VAPA/B, key tethers at many MCS [@saitaPromotionNeuriteExtension2009] [@matsuzakiProtrudinServesAdaptor2011][@hashimotoProtrudinRegulatesEndoplasmic2014][@elbaz-alonPDZD8InteractsProtrudin2020].  It may also act at ER-mitochondrial contact sites, which are important for axonal function and growth [@elbaz-alonPDZD8InteractsProtrudin2020][@leeIncreasedERMitochondria2019], and may be disrupted in neurodegenerative disease (reviewed in [@bernard-marissalEndoplasmicReticulumMitochondria2018]).  In addition, protrudin itself has been shown to act as a tether at ER-endosome contact sites, as it contains a phophoinositide-binding FYVE domain, as well as several motifs that can bind Rab proteins [@raiborgRepeatedEREndosome2015].  It may also play a role in ER-plasma membrane contacts, as protrudin contains a non-canonical FYVE domain that interacts more strongly with PM lipids than those more abundant on endosomes [@gilPhosphoinositidesDifferentiallyRegulate2012].  

##### Axonal ER

The axonal ER is comprised of only a few very narrow, continuous tubules, and yet is essential for normal axonal function.  As protrudin localises to ER tubules, it can be found in the axon, although in mature neurons it is more abundant in the cell body and dendrites.  However, it is not excluded from the axon, as it readily moves into the axon if overexpressed [@petrovaProtrudinFunctionsEndoplasmic2020].  Nevertheless, protrudin interacts with a number of important axonal ER components, although it remains unclear exactly what function protrudin has in this compartment.  

Protrudin contains a membrane hairpin domain, which is shared with other proteins that play a role in ER membrane shaping [@changProtrudinBindsAtlastins2013].  Several of these are implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP), a group of axon degenerative diseases, which may stem from fragmentation of the axonal ER [@yalcinModelingAxonalEndoplasmic2017].  Protrudin itself has been considered an HSP gene [@mannanZFYVE27SPG33Novel2006], although there is some controversy in this area, and the 'mutation' invovled may actually be a benign polymorphism [@martignoniRoleZFYVE27Protrudin2008].  However, protrudin does interact with spastin, atlastin, and other HSP proteins, so it may still play a role in these conditions[@changProtrudinBindsAtlastins2013].  

While dysfunction of these ER-shaping proteins can lead to axonal degeneration, their function is also required for axon regeneration, where they appear to concentrate ER tubules near the growing tip [@raoSpastinAtlastinER2016].  Protrudin may act in the same way, as [@petrovaProtrudinFunctionsEndoplasmic2020] found that protrudin increases the amount of ER in growth cones.

The axonal ER also acts as a local calcium store, and its capacity is regulated by membrane shaping proteins via tubule diameter.  Protrudin may act in the same way, although it is unclear how this may or may not contribute to protrudin's regenerative function, as different ER-shaping proteins have been shown to have opposing effects on axon regeneration [@konnoEndoplasmicReticulumMorphological2021][@alhajlahOverexpressionReticulonEnhances2021].

With these diverse roles across numerous cellular functions, protrudin could be influencing neuronal survival and regeneration through several different mechanisms.  My aim throughout this project has been to shed more light on which pathways contribute to the beneficial effects of protrudin seen in studies such as [@petrovaProtrudinFunctionsEndoplasmic2020].  This is primarily intended to inform the translation of protrudin as a gene therapy for neurodegenerative conditions and CNS injury, although further work could also identify new therapeutic targets in the same pathways.
