# Investigating protrudin's role in neuroprotection and axon regeneration in the central nervous system
## PhD Thesis

This repository contains all the text, data, and code used to produce my PhD thesis.  The final thesis is available open access at https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.104725.

The tags on this repository indicate the state it was in when my thesis was submitted for examination and later accepted with corrections.  Some changes have been made since then, primarily adding files that were used to generate the thesis but missed in the original commits, as well as a few small tweaks to keep the code running with newer versions of R.

The code included in this repository (notably that in the `scripts_and_macros` directory, which is most likely to be of use to other researchers) is freely available to use and modify.  If you use this extensively for your own work, please cite this thesis.
